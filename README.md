# Noctowl

Noctowl is a SwiftUI birding app focused on fast identification, a clean life list, and a polished, glass-forward interface. It is my first App Store project and will be used in my portfolio.

## Features
- Identify: full-bleed hero carousel with quick record/camera actions
- Library: Gallery and Recordings hubs
- Life List: searchable sightings list
- Map + Community placeholders for upcoming features
- App-wide theme and accent control

## Tech Stack
- SwiftUI
- iOS 17+ (glass effects)

## Getting Started
1. Open `Noctowl.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Select a simulator or device.
3. Build & run.

## Roadmap
- Real data models (sightings, recordings, photos)
- Media capture + audio analysis pipeline
- Search across sightings and media
- App Store release polish
